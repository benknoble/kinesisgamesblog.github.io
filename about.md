My name is Kishan Takoordyal. I am primarily a video game developer focussed mainly on the programming side of things. 
As well as having been a Google Code-In finalist in 2018, I specialise in many fields of tech including web development. 
I always look forward to participating in hackathons such as IETF's or locally hosted ones along with CyberStorm.mu, an
organisation comprising of several other open-source contributors and experts I form part of in my home country, 
Mauritius, while occasionally trying out new linux distros. 

Besides everything related to tech, I have the following qualities:

- I rock a great mustache.
- I'm extremely loyal to my family.
- I'm funny with a pinch of shitty puns.

What else do you need?

### My History

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just visit
