The African Peering and Interconnection Forum addresses the key interconnection, peering,
and traffic exchange opportunities and challenges on the continent and provides participants
with global and regional insights for maximising opportunities that will help grow Internet
infrastructure and services in Africa. The session of 2019 took place at the Intercontinental
Hotel at Balaclava in Mauritius.

## Day 1 - Tuesday

Unfortunately, a lot of members of [CyberStorm.mu](https://cyberstorm.mu) couldn't attend the
first day due to various reasons. I was really looking forward to going to the event and meeting
interesting people. Me, [Nathan](https://tecknologg.website/), Didier and Nishant reached the 
Intercontinental Hotel at around 12 30. After taking a cafe, we went for lunch. The food was
great and I ate so much that I couldn't ingest more at night, later that day. Then, me and 
[Nathan](https://tecknologg.website/) followed conferences led by various entities in Mauritius
who tried to convince organisations and societies present to make links with them. They were talking
about the GDP and population of islands in the Indian Ocean while contrasting with the benefits
our country provided. We again had a coffee break after which we assisted to another conference about
policies. Of course, during our whole journey there, Me and [Nathan](https://tecknologg.website/)
picked up goodies from the many organisations present. We had got a ton of brochures, shirts, pens, 
a pair of wireless earphones and various other misc stuff at the end of the day.

## Day 2 - Wednesday

I woke up early and met with other members of the [CyberStorm.mu](https://cyberstorm.mu) team.
There were [Logan](https://medium.com/@loganaden), [Jeremie](https://medium.com/@jeremiedaniel48), 
[Kifah](https://blog.maskys.com), [Nathan](https://tecknologg.website/), [Muzaffar](https://muzaffar.xyz/),
Codarren, Didier, Nishant and myself present. We had breakfast with members of the 
[Internet Society](https://www.internetsociety.org/) while talking about [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/)
and lightly discussing about all the progress made in this sector. 

After walking around and talking to other individuals, we assisted to conferences about internet standards
and technologies being used, one of which was led by [Logan](https://medium.com/@loganaden) from 
[AFRINIC](https://afrinic.net/). After having lunch, we further attended some more conferences until we had to
head back home.

Unfortunately, none of us could attend on Day 3. Overall, it was a fun and enriching experience even if
most of us didn't understand much in some conferences. It was awesome meeting new people, the food was
excellent and the goodies were really much more than what we expected them to be.

## Meeting with the Director of Network Engineering of Cloudflare

I was really looking forward to meeting [Jerome Fleury](https://twitter.com/Jerome_UZ) of
[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) from 13 00 to 15 00 at the Voila Hotel at Bagatelle.
I met friends and members of [CyberStorm.mu](https://cyberstorm.mu). [Jerome](https://twitter.com/Jerome_UZ) 
briefly talked about how security was overlooked and wasn't a primary consideration on the internet 
years ago initially before introducing us to the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) which is basically a routing 
protocol used to transfer data and information between different host gateways, the Internet or autonomous systems.

He then gave examples of major BGP leaks which occured over the past couple of years. Essentially, a BGP leak
is the redirection of traffic through an unintended path, which, in the context of the current discussion, may
result in an overload. These major BGP leaks were mostly result of misconfigurations.

The example of the recent BGP leak involving Verizon was heavily used for further explanations. In few lines,
an Internet Service Provider, DQE Communications was using a BGP optimizer, which meant that they had more 
specific routes to their destination. These specific routes were announced to their customer, Allegheny Technologies 
Inc, this information further being sent to a transit provider, Verizon, which is also a Tier 1 internet provider.
These specific routes shouldn't be forwarded to the rest of the Internet. Unfortunately, due to Verizon's lack of
filtering, Verizon, Allegheny, and DQE suddenly had to deal with a drastic increase in traffic. These networks 
weren't suitably equipped to deal with all this traffic. This rendered many services online inaccessible and 
a noticeable difference in speed.

Further more, [Jerome](https://twitter.com/Jerome_UZ) talked about easy solutions that can be implemented to
prevent BGP leaks. This includes adopting peer locking mechanisms which makes Tier 1 internet providers reject
routes of other Tier 1 internet providers or setting up RPKI, which is a Public Key Infrastructure framework
suitable to routage, requiring signed SSL certificates. Other solutions also include configuring routers with
[MANRS](https://www.manrs.org/) or IRR filtering. A lot of BGP leaks can be easily avoided if all major internet
providers did efforts to implement all these solutions. Fortunately, the Verizon BGP leak was resolved by 
phone calls by the network team at [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). It was a really interesting and
instructive meetup, and it wasn't so hard grasping what [Jerome](https://twitter.com/Jerome_UZ) was talking about.
