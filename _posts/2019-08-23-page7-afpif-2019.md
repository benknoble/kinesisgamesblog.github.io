The African Peering and Interconnection Forum addresses the key interconnection, peering,
and traffic exchange opportunities and challenges on the continent and provides participants
with global and regional insights for maximising opportunities that will help grow Internet
infrastructure and services in Africa.

## Day 1 - Tuesday

Unfortunately, a lot of members of [CyberStorm.mu](https://cyberstorm.mu) couldn't attend the
first day due to various reasons. I was really looking forward to going to the event and meeting
interesting people. Me, [Nathan](https://tecknologg.website/), Didier and Nishant reached the 
Intercontinental Hotel at around 12 30. After taking a cafe, we went for lunch. The food was
great and I ate so much that I couldn't ingest more at night, later that day. Then, me and 
[Nathan](https://tecknologg.website/) followed conferences led by various entities in Mauritius
who tried to convince organisations and societies present to make links with them. They were talking
about the GDP and population of islands in the Indian Ocean while contrasting with the benefits
our country provided. We again had a coffee break after which we assisted to another conference about
policies. Of course, during our whole journey there, Me and [Nathan](https://tecknologg.website/)
picked up goodies from the many organisations present. We had got a ton of brochures, shirts, pens, 
a pair of wireless earphones and various other misc stuff at the end of the day.

## Day 2 - Wednesday

I woke up early and met with other members of the [CyberStorm.mu](https://cyberstorm.mu) team.
There were [Logan](https://medium.com/@loganaden), [Jeremie](https://medium.com/@jeremiedaniel48), 
[Kifah](https://blog.maskys.com), [Nathan](https://tecknologg.website/), [Muzaffar](https://muzaffar.xyz/),
Codarren, Didier, Nishant and myself present. We had breakfast with members of the 
[Internet Society](https://www.internetsociety.org/) while talking about [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/)
and lightly discussing about all the progress made in this sector. 

After walking around and talking to other individuals, we assisted to conferences about internet standards
and technologies being used, one of which was led by [Logan](https://medium.com/@loganaden) from 
[AFRINIC](https://afrinic.net/). After having lunch, we further attended some more conferences until we had to
head back home.

Unfortunately, none of us could attend on Day 3. Overall, it was a fun and enriching experience even if
most of us didn't understand much in some conferences. It was awesome meeting new people, the food was
excellent and the goodies were really much more than what we expected them to be.
