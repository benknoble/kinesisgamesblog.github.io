## The Switch to Linux Mint

Windows lagged sometimes and really made me rage. I had to wait for some seconds just for 
a right click on the desktop and some of my operations just froze for some time. On top of 
that, blue screens of death whenever I updated drivers or idk and long updates introducing 
nothing useful but just delaying my work. I was really done and decided to move to Linux 
permanently. I had already booted into Kali Linux before but never really spent hours using 
it. I searched about the distro most convenient to me. There were a lot of people using 
Ubuntu but I found myself attracted to Linux Mint. Mint is pretty similar to Ubuntu except 
that it offers more customisability as far as I know. I made my partitions, a live disk and 
tada! It wasn't that hard to adjust. I found tools to replace the ones I had on Windows and 
with the themes and the various options, I was quite used to it. I also loved the terminal 
and no longer wanted to use a mouse. Of course, whenever I wanted to game or use a program 
that I didn't find a replacement for on Linux, I'd pay a visit to dear Windows since I was 
using a dual boot configuration.

## Learning more and more

I continued to research and this yielded in me understanding a lot on how Linux worked.
Everything fascinated me; how the great Linus Torvalds built the Linux Kernel, the
evolution of OS from the time Unix was created into BSD and all the other ones, etc... In
Linux, everything is treated as a file and this is how I understood the purpose of folders
in the root (`/`) directory. I loved the history of how everything evolved into what they are
today and being a distro-hopper, I switched to other distros around each 2 weeks (need time
to prepare, do my partitions and wait for the ISP to provide some more GBs of Internet).

## The final switch (Manjaro Deepin)

I tried several linux distros (Ubuntu, Mint, POP! OS, Elementary OS) and desktop environments
(XFCE, KDE, GNOME, Cinnamon) but in the end, I found my sweet spot. I always hoped the next
linux distro I'd try would have features I'd have liked that I didn't have in my current 
distro but they never did; until I stepped into the Arch and Manjaro territory. While Manjaro
is based on Arch, it has all of the advantages that Arch offers. Arch allows any desktop
environment to be used on top of the OS and has one of the best and most complete documentation
and community I have ever seen. The docs possibly have solutions for any issues and distros
based on Arch profit from all of its commands. I opted for Manjaro instead because it is
supposedly more stable and refined than Arch. There are tons of ways to install packages on
Arch based distros (pacman, AUR, snap, AppImages, compile from source) and they provide much
more customizability than other popular distros. They also get package and kernal updates fast.

I tried a lot of desktop environments on Manjaro but finally settled for the Deepin one. The
Deepin edition can be toggled to look like many desktop environments and also uses its own
apps (not third-party like Dolphin as file manager for example) as default ones, boosting
performance. I will still continue to try out other distros tho.
