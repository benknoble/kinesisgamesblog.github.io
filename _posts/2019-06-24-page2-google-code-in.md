Basically, the Google Code-In is an annual event hosted by Google where 
13-18 y/o students can participate. Selected open-source organisations 
create tasks. Students claim, do and submit these tasks. This event goes 
on for some 1.5 months. In the end, students who have contributed more to 
the projects of open-source organisations are selected as winners or 
finalists. You should probably read more about it on its 
[official website](https://codein.withgoogle.com/about/). I really learnt 
a lot during this whole time and wasn't that bad in completing tasks. I 
learnt how to ssh, learnt regex and even  became quite good in HTML/CSS. 
I was chosen as a finalist and was a bit deceived not having been a winner 
but I find the work I did insufficient for being a winner anyway. I'd 
probably have reached that other step if I knew some more stuff before the 
contest. Then, I contributed to some open source projects on github and 
made a lot of important changes and new features. Before participating in 
the Google Code-In, I had no idea what terms such as vagrant, ansible, isort, 
flake8, coveralls, travis ci, git, markdown, docker images and python tests 
meant. I'll forever be grateful to my mentors during GCI, to Google and to 
everyone else having helped me to learn and understand what I know today. 
I now know the value of open source and I'll continue to contribute to it.

## What happened next

Like I said previously, I'm still learning new things and developing 
video games. I enjoy the things I do even if I'm really very busy these 
days. Sometimes I maintain my websites too. I participate in some events 
from time to time, win some contests and have articles written about me. 
I also form part of an organisation now, 
[cyberstorm.mu](https://cyberstorm.mu). We are a team of open source 
developers and represent our country in tech events and hackathons. I feel 
really proud of what I can do or know even if I'm not practically perfect 
or anything. Sometimes I also tinker with my Raspberry PI using my phone 
via VNC and a hotspot, and at school, I have an activity club to teach 
students about how to make videogames. That's it for my unusual life yet! 
There'll probably be more webpages on this website. Follow me on social 
networks to be updated on what I do!
